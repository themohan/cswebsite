<li><font size="4">It is a well-known fact that behind every good comet is a UFO. These UFOs often come to collect loyal groups from here on Earth.<br/> Both the name of the group and the name of the comet are converted into a number in the following manner: the final number is just<br/> the product of all the letters in the name, where "A" is 1 and "Z" is 26. For instance, the group "USACO" would be 21 * 19 * 1 * 3 * 15 =<br/> 17955. If the group's number mod 47 is the same as the comet's number mod 47, then you need to tell the group to get ready! (Remember<br/> that "a mod b" is the remainder left over after dividing a by b; 34 mod 10 is 4.). Write a program which reads in the name of the comet and <br/>the name of the group and figures out whether according to the above scheme the names are a match, printing "GO" if they match and "STAY" <br/>if not. The names of the groups and the comets will be a string of capital letters with no spaces or punctuation, up to 6 characters long. .</font>
